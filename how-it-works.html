          <h3>Tell Us About Your Project</h3>
          <p>Fill out our free project enquiry form with your requirements, location, timeline, and budget range. The more detail you provide—including photos, plans, or documents—the better we can match you with suitable professionals. Be realistic with your budget; if it doesn't align with the scope of work, we can't guarantee trade responses. You only pay the tradesperson you choose to hire.</p>
          <p class="process-note">Our automated system efficiently processes your project requirements, location preferences, and complexity to identify suitable trades. Before reaching out to network partners, we personally review every enquiry and verify all project documentation for accuracy and completeness. This combination of automation and human oversight ensures tradespeople receive clear, actionable project briefs.</p>

          <h3>Smart Matching & Connection</h3>
          <p>We match your project with suitable trade professionals from our vetted network. Selected trades contact you directly to discuss requirements, arrange site visits (strongly recommended), and provide quotes. Using AI to price a job without accurate measurements from site or architect plans is no better than guessing over the phone. If both you and the tradesperson agree a site visit isn't needed, that's your call.</p>
          <p class="process-note">Our coordination platform uses automated analysis to match project requirements with tradie capabilities, availability, and location. While automation helps us process matches faster, we maintain strict quality standards and never rely solely on AI estimations for pricing or scope—real projects need real site assessments.</p>

          <h3>Quality Work Gets Done</h3>
          <p>Selected trade professionals contact you directly to discuss your project, arrange site visits, and provide quotes. Our network partners pay a small success fee when they win jobs, giving them access to our coordination platform and business support tools. We work closely with trades on process improvements and operations—the more quality work they deliver, the higher they rank for future projects.</p>
          <p class="process-note">Throughout your project, you work directly with your chosen tradesperson on all aspects of the work—scheduling, communication, and progress. Our role is connecting you with quality trades and ensuring clear project briefs at the start. From there, it's a direct relationship between you and the professional delivering your project.</p>

<!-- AI Philosophy Section -->
  <section class="ai-philosophy-section">
    <div class="container container-narrow">
      <h2>Technology That Gives Tradies a Fair Shot</h2>
      <p class="lead">We build tools that help small operators compete with the big construction companies—not replace workers with algorithms</p>
      
      <div class="philosophy-content">
        <p>Small trade businesses and medium-sized contractors are constantly up against massive construction companies with huge admin teams and enterprise software. It's nearly impossible to compete when you're spending half your week on quotes, scheduling, and paperwork instead of actual work. We use modern tools to level the playing field—giving you the efficiency of a large company without the overhead or the risk of becoming dependent on technology that could disappear tomorrow.</p>

        <h4>Our Approach: Tools, Not Dependencies</h4>
        <p>We could automate your entire office away with AI—but then what happens when the power goes out? Or when tech platforms change their pricing model overnight? Your business shuts down, that's what. We build systems that make you more efficient, not more vulnerable. If technology failed tomorrow, you could still operate—it would just take more time.</p>
        
        <h4>What This Actually Means</h4>
        <div class="ai-benefits">
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Save Time, Not Jobs:</strong> We help you cut admin hours so your existing team can focus on what they're good at—not so you can fire people and replace them with software.
          </div>
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Compete with the Big Guys:</strong> Small operators get access to coordination tools and systems that used to only be available to large companies with dedicated admin teams.
          </div>
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Your Business Stays Yours:</strong> Technology makes things easier, but you're never locked into expensive platforms or dependent on services that could change pricing overnight.
          </div>
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Get Time Back:</strong> Modern systems can genuinely give you significant time back each week—time for actual work, business growth, or life outside of work.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Our Commitment: Building Tools, Not Firing Workers</h4>
        <p>We explicitly refuse to help businesses "AI away" their workforce. That's not innovation—that's just cost-cutting dressed up in tech language. When we work with trade businesses, our goal is to give you tools that reduce the admin burden and improve efficiency. What you do with that extra time—grow the business, improve quality, actually enjoy your weekends—is up to you. But it won't be because you fired half your team.</p>
        
        <p>Technology should give small operators a fair shot at competing, not make them dependent on expensive subscriptions or vulnerable to platform changes. We build with that philosophy, or we don't build at all.</p>
