  <!-- AI Philosophy Section -->
  <section class="ai-philosophy-section">
    <div class="container container-narrow">
      <h2>Technology That Empowers, Not Replaces</h2>
      <p class="lead">We believe in using AI and automation to enhance human expertise, not eliminate it</p>
      
      <div class="philosophy-content">
        <p>Our approach to technology is simple: we use AI and modern tools to handle repetitive tasks and improve coordination, allowing skilled tradespeople to focus on what they do best—quality craftsmanship. This means faster responses, better matching, and more efficient project management without losing the human touch that ensures quality work.</p>

        <h4>The Three-Tier System: Built for Reliability</h4>
        <p>Every process in our business operates on three levels, ensuring we can deliver results regardless of technology availability:</p>
        
        <div class="tiers-list">
          <div class="tier">
            <span class="tier-label">Level 1: Manual</span>
            <p>Traditional methods using phone, email, and spreadsheets. If all technology failed tomorrow, we could still operate—it would just take more coffee and phone calls.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tier">
            <span class="tier-label">Level 2: Digital</span>
            <p>Modern online systems, forms, and databases create efficiency without dependency on AI. This is our baseline operational level—fast, reliable, proven.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tier">
            <span class="tier-label">Level 3: AI-Enhanced</span>
            <p>Smart automation, predictive matching, and AI analysis optimize everything when available. This is where we achieve maximum efficiency—but it's an enhancement, not a dependency.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>What This Means for Your Project</h4>
        <div class="ai-benefits">
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Faster Matching:</strong> AI helps us analyze your requirements and identify suitable trades in minutes, not hours.
          </div>
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Better Communication:</strong> Automated updates keep you informed without overwhelming you with details.
          </div>
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Quality Unchanged:</strong> The actual work is still done by skilled, experienced tradespeople—technology just helps them work more efficiently.
          </div>
          <div class="ai-benefit">
            <strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Every AI recommendation is reviewed by real people who understand construction and trade work.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Our Commitment: Empowering Growth, Not Cutting Jobs</h4>
        <p>We explicitly design our technology to help businesses grow with their existing teams, not replace workers. When we work with trade businesses, our goal is to give them tools that reduce admin burden, improve efficiency, and ultimately give them back 10-15 hours per week. That time can be reinvested in quality work, business growth, or better work-life balance—not staff reductions.</p>
